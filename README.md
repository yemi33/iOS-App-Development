Submitted by: **Yemi Shin**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

# User Stories
The following required functionality is complete:

[V] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
[V] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following optional features are implemented:

[V] UI animations
[ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
[ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
[V] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following additional features are implemented:

[V] Clearing the entry when the 'clear button' is pressed.
[V] A settings page where the user can enter a default tip amount, which is reflected on the deafault tab of the segmented control.

# Notes
It got fairly difficult when I ran into issues with the application where the reasons were not immediately apparent. Spending much time trouble shooting and adjusting configurations or details that I did not get right the first time was at times a burdensome task but also a constructive one. Now I feel like I learned many new concepts that I could only learn by experience, such as the many functionalities of Swift and different ways to design and implement a full ios application.
